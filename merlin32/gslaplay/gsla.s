* New Animated File Format
*
*
* xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxx is the number of bytes 1-16384 to follow (0 == 1 byte)
*
* %0xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxx1 - Copy Bytes - straight copy bytes
* %1xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxx1 - Skip Bytes - skip bytes / move the cursor
* %1xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxx0 - Dictionary Copy Bytes from  frame buffer to frame buffer
* 
* %0000_0000_0000_0000- Source Skip -> Source pointer skips to next bank of data
* %0000_0000_0000_0010- End of Frame - end of frame
* %0000_0000_0000_0110- End of Animation / End of File / no more frames
*
* other remaining codes, are reserved for future expansion
*
*
* 16 bit opcode
*
* %1 xxx xxxx xxxx xxx 0
* %0 xxx xxxx xxxx xxx 0
*
* X = SRC
* Y = DST
*
* Source Data Stream Copy
* Dictionary Copy
* xx xxxx xxxx xxxx // up to 16384 length of copy (0 is a copy length of 1 byte, so it's length-1)
*
* Copy this code to your direct page, please make sure it's aligned to a page
* The buffer is hardcoded to be at $012000, to take advantage of fast reads
*
* pass in a pointer to the start of the compressed stream
* ldx #offset in source bank
* lda #source bank
*  we assume all next bank data is sequential from this first bank, but it
* wouldn't be hard to work from a list of banks, to make the player more
* friendly

*---  this code sits at location $0 in the DP register
*---  DP may be anywhere in bank 0, but make sure it's PAGE aligned
*---- for performance reasons

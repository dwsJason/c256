MIX Oscillator - 256 bytes per Oscillator - why 256 bytes?

256 bytes, and page aligned, the oscillator can live in the direct page
Oscillator code, can be optimized to use DP variables, and we can run the next
Oscillator by moving to another page

The plan is to support different Oscillator types, at least for version 1, I
plan on having support for 3 types of Oscillators

8  bit PCM
16 bit PCM
16 bit ADPCM

Future Oscillators might support ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain Release)
Or they might support SNES BRR format
Or they could support Apple IIgs format PCM audio
Someone might tackle ORBIS encoding

Having plenty of scratch space seems like a good idea, 256 bytes is a lot,
but also if the decoder is complex, it might not be challenge to fit it all
in there.

- I think some parts of the OSCillator needs to be common to all OSC types

        ds 2  ; Version/Type - what type of OSC is this (which decoder is called)
        ds 2  ; state, stopped or playing
        ds 4  ; pWave Data - Pointer to the Wave data
        ds 4  ; pWave Data Loop Point
        ds 4  ; pWave End  - Pointer to the end of the wave data
        ds 2  ; Playback frequency
        ds 2  ; Channel Volume
        ds 2  ; Pan (left/right pan value)
